- 🐶 Hi, I’m @FaultyFosters
- 👀 I’m interested in coming to grips with some of the tech I need to make videos etc about our foster dogs. It helps rescue dogs to get adopted by families or individuals that underestand them better and look forward to helping them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get Mousecape to work on the Preview application - somehow I just cannot get rid of the crosshairs!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that links to getting dogs rehomed & rescues out of kennels!
- 📫 Drop me a note here...
